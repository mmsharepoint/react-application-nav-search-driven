# Application Top Placeholder Navigation

## Summary

This is an SPFx extension acting as a Top placeholder. It uses a FluentUi CommandBar to display a search-driven navigation and diverse permission settings of artefacts in the current side on the right. It furthermore notifies if current site is enabled for external sharing or not.
